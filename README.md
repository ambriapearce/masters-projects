# Data Science Master's Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science Master's portfolio. Below are a collection of different academic and applied projects that demonstrate my experience across data analysis, machine learning and data visualisation. Each project explores different aspects of real-world data challenges.

---

## Project 1 - [Income Analysis Using US Census Data](https://github.com/ambriapearce/income-analysis-US-census-data)
**Tools Used:** Orange3, Python, PUMS Dataset (Public Use Microdata Sample)  
**Focus Area:** Data Preprocessing, Predictive Modelling, Demographic Insights

This project analyses US Census data to explore patterns and inequalities in income distribution. Using Orange3 I performed **Data Preprocessing**, **Statistical Analysis** and **Model Evaluation** to:
- Examine the fairness of income distribution across demographic groups.
- Predict income levels using selected socio-economic features.
- Indetify correlations between demographic trends and US election outcomes.

⭐️ **key skills:** Data Mining, Feature Engineering, Data Ethics, Predictive Analytics

## Project 2 - [AI & Machine Learning Image Classification](https://github.com/ambriapearce/ai-machine-learning-image-classification)
**Tools Used:** Python, TensorFlow/Keras, GridWorld, NumPy, Matplotlib  
**Focus Area:** Machine Learning, Image Processing, Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, Value Iteration, Q-Learning

This project integrates both supervised and reinforcment learning techniques. Part one focuses on **image classification** using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to explore model architecture, feature extraction and performance optimisation. Part 2 explores **reinforcement learning**, comparing **Q-learning** and **Value Iteration** algorithms in simulated environmnets to understand their effectiveness in decision-making and policy optimisation. 

⭐️ **key skills:** Deep Learning, CNNs, Reinforcement Learning, Experimental Design, Algorithm Evaluation

## Project 3 - [Big Data Project - COVID-19 in England](https://github.com/ambriapearce/big-data-project-covid-england)
**Tools Used:** Tableau, Excel, Powerpoint  
**Focus Area:** Public Health Insights, Data Visualisation, Big Data Analytics

This project investigates the relationship between reported **COVID-19** cases and hospital admissions across English regions. Using large scale data, I processed and visualised temporal and geographic trends to assess:
- Regional disparities in infection and hospitalisation rates.
- The timing and intensity of peaks across NHS regions.
- Potential implications for resource allocation and public health policy.

⭐️ **key skills:** Big Data Preprocessing, Tableau Dashboards, Public Health Analytics, Data Storytelling

## Project 4 - [Spotify Song Dataset Analyser](https://github.com/ambriapearce/spotify-song-dataset-analyser)
**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, SQLite, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
**Focus Area:** Data Analysis, Recommendation Systems

This project involved developing a song dataset analyser using a publicly available dataset, song.csv, which contains information on the top 2000 Spotify tracks from 1998 to 2020. The aim was to build an interactive analysis tool that enables users to explore song characteristics and identify similarities between tracks.
Tasks included:
- Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset for analysis.
- Exploring trends in popularity and tempo over time.
- Implementing algorithms to recommend songs with simmilar attributes.
- Visualising key relationships between musical features and popularity.

⭐️ **key skills:** Data Preprocessing, EDA, Data Visualisation

## Dissertation Project - Identifying Early Risk Factors for Prediabetes Using Explainable Machine Learning: A Binary Classification Approach
**(To be added at a later date)**  
**Focus Area:** Predictive Modelling, Healthcare Data, Explainable AI (XAI)

This Project explored the application of machine learning and explainable artificial intelligence algorithms to identify early risk factors for **Prediabetes**, a crucial transitional stage between normoglycaemia and Type II Diabetes. The study addressed common challenges in healthcare modelling like imbalanced datasets and model transparency by evaluating and comparing multiple algorithms including **Random Forest**, **Logistic Regression**, **Neural Network** and **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)**. The goal was to asses predictive and interpretability showing how XAI methods can improve clinical trust and understanding in early risk detection.

⭐️ **key skills:** XAI, Model Interpretability, Data Imbalance Handling, Predictive Modelling
